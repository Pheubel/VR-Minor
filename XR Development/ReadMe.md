We wanted to expand the decor of the training area, one of which ways was to add posters to the area. To stay within the futuristic theme, I decided to make a hologram shader. To start I watched Brackey's tutorial on how to create a holographic in Unity using shader graphs ([HOLOGRAM using Unity Shader Graph](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KGGB5LFEejg )).

After I had lines and emmission working after the tutorial i decided i wanted to add some grain to add to the holographic look. For this I experimented around with noise generation nodes and settled on using gradient noise as it's pattern works well for simulating the dithering pattern. I made the noise pattern change by changing the UV offset with the time passed.

Inside our enviroment we used it to display the safety measures.
