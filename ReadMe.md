##  Pressure Cooker
  
  
###  Concept
  
###  Explanation
  
The user opperates a time machine boat to save people on the flooding canals of Amsterdam.
###  Moodboard
  
As a theme for the boat i want to have a mix of the past, today and the tomorrow that will never be, steampunk.

###  Storyboard

###  Goal
  
  
###  Assets
  
####  Goal
  
incrementing goals:
* plunger (beginner)
* steering wheel (novice)
* boat (advanced)
  
####  Research
  
I started with researching the basics of how to use Blender 3, for this I watched the first episode of Blender guru's "Blender 3.0 Beginner Donut Tutorial"<sup>[1](#pc-assets-fn-1 )</sup>. 
  
After this i messed around in Blender to get a feel for how to use the tools by adding more objects.
![](Pressure%20Cooker/DocAssets/donut%20modeling.png?0.7050839741294339 )  
  
I want to use a reference image in Blender, but i have not used them before. After finding an article online<sup>[2](#pc-asset-fn-2 )</sup> i followed the steps shown there to import images for reference use.
  
I used a reference for a plunger with a good side view.

When i was done i noticed that I had issues with the mesh having dark spots, this was because of faulty normals, I had duplicate vertices that i had to delete. Afterwards my model looked fine.
  
Later i modeled a steering wheel for my ship. I made use of mirroring to reduce work, but i ran into trouble when dealing with the spokes, as it had overlapping issues.

![](Pressure%20Cooker/DocAssets/overlapWheelWireframe.png?0.48873371600641313 )  
  
After much experimentation i removed the overlaps and was able to export it. By combining the overlaps i was able to make in intermediate shape that i could use to cut out a shape in the spokes and was then able to join them together.

####  Evaluation
  
I feel that I've made good progress with learning Blender, as i wasn't really skilled with it. I did however spend more time on it than I should have, trying to get things working well, eating away at time that I could've used elsewhere.
  
###  Development
  
VR development in Unity has changed quite a bit since i last used it. I want to be able to be more proficient again. 
  
####  Goal
  
* Be able to set up a VR project from scratch.
* Interact with the game world.
  
####  Research
  
To get started i watched Justin P. Barnett's tutorial to develop VR games in Unity<sup>[1](#pc-dev-fn-1 )</sup>, as it is a recent video with a Unity version close to the latest release.
  
Setting this up was rather easy, however when trying to get it to work with a quest, i ran into issues with it not connecting to Unity. After asking classmates they told me to enable unknown sources in the oculus app. I was nnow able to have headtracking working, but the controller tracking was not working properly. After asking around I searched the oculus forums and discovered i had missed a step, I did not set Oculus to the active XR runtime. Once i had pressed this button i had no more issues with tracking in Unity.

####  Evaluation
  
I feel like i can properly set up and work in a VR project now. Figuring out what caused my problems with tracking for the Quest had eaten up more time than it should've. But i think it was worth struggling for, as i can now properly debug using a headset that is relatively easy to jump into for debugging.
  
  
  
  
  
#  XR Assets
  
  
##  Sprint 1
  
  
For this sprint I took it upon myself to create the model for the instructor robot, As I want to improve my Blender skills. 
  
To begin, our team had created a moodboard for the robot. I used that to create a prototype in blender.
![](XR%20Assets/DocAssets/RobotMoodboard.jpeg?0.30134282217594555 )  
  
First off I made some concepts of the robot's head, I modeled  3 different shapes I envisioned as a possible head.
  
![](XR%20Assets/DocAssets/robohoofden.png?0.5781795418289284 )  
  
After showing it to the rest of my team we settle on going with the head on the right, as it looks like a monitor.
  
For the body I tried out a different style of shaping the model. First I made a rough shape by extruding and resizing the edges of a cube.
  
![](XR%20Assets/DocAssets/robo%20lichaam%20base.PNG?0.7171841183414001 )  
  
Once i had the shape I applied a Subdivision Surface to the mesh, this helped round it out.
  
![](XR%20Assets/DocAssets/robo%20lichaam%20vervorming.PNG?0.7803820242952495 )  
  
I made the arms by first creating a few basic shapes and then combining them together into a single mesh with the Boolean modifier on the union setting. This causes the object it filters for to be added to the mesh it was applied on.
  
I then wanted to add an armature to the robot, I followed the steps in https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Bones, I added bones starting from the main body and alligned them with the joints of the robot.

##  Learning Goals
  
  
###  Overarching goals
  
  
* Asset creation
  * By the end of this semester...
I have built up the knowledge to fully model rig and texture in blender so that I can be part of the asset creation process.
  
  * By the end of this semester...
I have made shaders that can be animated and interactable in Unity so that I can develop good looking environments in the project.
  
###  Short term goals
  
  
Sprint 1
  
* Asset creation
  * By the end of this sprint...
I have created three model using blender get a basis footing in modelling skills.
  
  * By the end of this sprint... 
I have rigged a model using Blender to make it easier to animate.
