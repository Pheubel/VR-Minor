####  Research
  
I started with researching the basics of how to use Blender 3, for this I watched the first episode of Blender guru's "Blender 3.0 Beginner Donut Tutorial"<sup>[1](#myfootnote1 )</sup>. After this i messed around in Blender to get a feel for how to use the tools by adding more objects.
