### Storyboard

### Goal

### Assets
#### Goal
incrementing goals:
* plunger (beginner)
* steering wheel (novice)
* boat (advanced)

#### Research
I started with researching the basics of how to use Blender 3, for this I watched the first episode of Blender guru's "Blender 3.0 Beginner Donut Tutorial"<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. 

After this i messed around in Blender to get a feel for how to use the tools by adding more objects.
@import "DocAssets/donut modeling.png"

I want to use a reference image in Blender, but i have not used them before. 

I used a reference for a plunger with a good side view.
@import "DocAssets/referenceInBlender.png"

When i was done i noticed that I had issues with the mesh having dark spots, this was because of faulty normals, I had duplicate vertices that i had to delete. Afterwards my model looked fine.

Later i modeled a steering wheel for my ship. I made use of mirroring to reduce work, but i ran into trouble when dealing with the spokes, as it had overlapping issues. 
@import "DocAssets/overlapWheel.png"
@import "DocAssets/overlapWheelWireframe.png"

After much experimentation i removed the overlaps and was able to export it. By combining the overlaps i was able to make in intermediate shape that i could use to cut out a shape in the spokes and was then able to join them together.

#### Creation

#### Evaluation
I feel that I've made good progress with learning Blender, as i wasn't really skilled with it. I did however spend more time on it than I should have, trying to get things working well, eating away at time that I could've used elsewhere.
