#### Research
I started with researching the basics of how to use Blender 3, for this I watched the first episode of Blender guru's "Blender 3.0 Beginner Donut Tutorial"<sup>[1](#myfootnote1)</sup>. 

After this i messed around in Blender to get a feel for how to use the tools by adding more objects.

I want to use a reference image in Blender, but i have not used them before. 

I used a reference for a plunger with a good side view.

When i was done i noticed that I had issues with the mesh having dark spots, this was because of faulty normals, I had duplicate vertices that i had to delete. Afterwards my model looked fine.
