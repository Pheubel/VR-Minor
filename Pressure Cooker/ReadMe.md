###  Concept
  
###  Explanation
  
The user opperates a time machine boat to save people on the flooding canals of Amsterdam.
###  Moodboard
  
As a theme for the boat i want to have a mix of the past, today and the tomorrow that will never be, steampunk.

####  Goal
  
incrementing goals:
* plunger (beginner)
* steering wheel (novice)
* boat (advanced)
  
####  Research
  
I started with researching the basics of how to use Blender 3, for this I watched the first episode of Blender guru's "Blender 3.0 Beginner Donut Tutorial"<sup>[1](#myfootnote1 )</sup>. 
  
After this i messed around in Blender to get a feel for how to use the tools by adding more objects.

I want to use a reference image in Blender, but i have not used them before. 
  
I used a reference for a plunger with a good side view.

When i was done i noticed that I had issues with the mesh having dark spots, this was because of faulty normals, I had duplicate vertices that i had to delete. Afterwards my model looked fine.
  
Later i modeled a steering wheel for my ship. I made use of mirroring to reduce work, but i ran into trouble when dealing with the spokes, as it had overlapping issues.

After much experimentation i removed the overlaps and was able to export it. By combining the overlaps i was able to make in intermediate shape that i could use to cut out a shape in the spokes and was then able to join them together.

####  Evaluation
  
I feel that I've made good progress with learning Blender, as i wasn't really skilled with it. I did however spend more time on it than I should have, trying to get things working well, eating away at time that I could've used elsewhere.
