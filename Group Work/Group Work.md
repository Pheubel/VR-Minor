### Sprint 5

After hard work together our project is nearly done, we've sat together with everything we still want to get made. In order to get volumetric lighting to work I got assistance from Chris Lokhorst from Astra. I continued to work with keafer to assist with the timeline and sat with Chris Mallet to make sure my code's quality was in order.
