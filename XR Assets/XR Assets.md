## XR Assets

### Sprint 1

For this sprint I took it upon myself to create the model for the instructor robot, As I want to improve my Blender skills. 

To begin, our team had created a moodboard for the robot. I used that to create a prototype in blender.

First off I made some concepts of the robot's head, I modeled  3 different shapes I envisioned as a possible head.

After showing it to the rest of my team we settle on going with the head on the right, as it looks like a monitor.

For the body I tried out a different style of shaping the model. First I made a rough shape by extruding and resizing the edges of a cube.

Once i had the shape I applied a Subdivision Surface to the mesh, this helped round it out.

I made the arms by first creating a few basic shapes and then combining them together into a single mesh with the Boolean modifier on the union setting. This causes the object it filters for to be added to the mesh it was applied on.

I then wanted to add an armature to the robot, I followed the steps in https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Bones, I added bones starting from the main body and alligned them with the joints of the robot.

In this sprint our team ahs finalized the design of the robot assistent, and i have been itterating over how to make it. For the new design we went with a less humanized look.
